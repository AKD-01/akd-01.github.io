                <h2>Learn the Fundamentals</h2>
                <p>
                    The first step to becoming a frontend developer is to learn the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML provides
                    the structure and content of web pages, CSS is used for styling and design, and JavaScript enables dynamic and
                    interactive web experiences. One of the best ways to learn is through online tutorials and courses. Many resources are
                    available, including Codecademy, Udemy, and Coursera, to name a few. The key is to practice coding simple web pages and
                    projects to gain experience and confidence.
                </p>
                <h3>Solution:</h3>

                    weaknesses, so it's important to research and choose the best options for your specific needs. You'll also need a code
                    editor, version control system, and package manager. Some popular options include Visual Studio Code, Git, and npm.
