            <p>Handling events with React elements is very similar to handling events on DOM elements. There are some syntax differences:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>React events are named using camelCase, rather than using lowercase like DOM elements.</li>
                <li>With JSX one can pass a function as the event handler, rather than a string.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>React Events occur on various actions like user action or system-generated events. For eg: window resize, web page loading, keypress, mouse hover, mouse click, and many other interactive actions are known as events.</p>
            <p>React consists of its own events handling systems which are very similar in the way we use to handling events on DOM elements. And event handling in react known as Synthetic events. The synthetic event is a cross-browser wrapper of the browserâ€™s native event.</p>
