          Handling events with React elements is very similar to handling events
          on DOM elements. There are some syntax differences:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            React events are named using camelCase, rather than using lowercase
            like DOM elements.
          </li>
          <li>
            With JSX one can pass a function as the event handler, rather than a
            string.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          React Events occur on various actions like user action or
          system-generated events. For eg: window resize, web page loading,
          keypress, mouse hover, mouse click, and many other interactive actions
          are known as events.
        </p>
        <p>
          React consists of its own events handling systems which are very
          similar in the way we use to handling events on DOM elements. And
          event handling in react known as Synthetic events. The synthetic event
          is a cross-browser wrapper of the browser‚Äôs native event.
        </p>

        <div class="image">
          <img
            width="400px"
            style="border-radius: 2rem"
            src="https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/reactjs/images/react-events.png"
            alt="Event Handlers"
          />
        </div>
        <p>For example, the HTML:</p>
        <pre><code class="html"><p>&lt;button onclick="activateLasers()"&gt;
  Activate Lasers
&lt;/button&gt;</p></code></pre>
        <p>is slightly different in React:</p>
        <pre><code class="html">&lt;button onClick={activateLasers}&gt;  Activate Lasers
&lt;/button&gt;</code></pre>
        <p>
          Another difference is that you cannot return false to prevent default
          behavior in React. You must call preventDefault explicitly. For
          example, with plain HTML, to prevent the default form behavior of
          submitting, you can write:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="html">&lt;form onsubmit="console.log('You clicked submit.'); return false"&gt;
  &lt;button type="submit">Submit&lt;/button &gt;
&lt;/form &gt;</code></pre>
        <p>In React, this could instead be:</p>
        <pre><code class="javascript">function Form() {
  function handleSubmit(e) {
    e.preventDefault();    
    console.log('You clicked submit.');
  }

  return (
    &lt;form onSubmit={handleSubmit}&gt;
      &lt;button type="submit"Submit&gt;&lt;/button &gt;
    &lt;/&form&gt;
      );
}</code></pre>
        <p>
          Here, e is a synthetic event. React defines these synthetic events
          according to the W3C spec, so you don‚Äôt need to worry about
          cross-browser compatibility. React events do not work exactly the same
          as native events. See the SyntheticEvent reference guide to learn
          more. When using React, you generally don‚Äôt need to call
          addEventListener to add listeners to a DOM element after it is
          created. Instead, just provide a listener when the element is
          initially rendered. When you define a component using an ES6 class, a
          common pattern is for an event handler to be a method on the class.
          For example, this Toggle component renders a button that lets the user
          toggle between ‚ÄúON‚Äù and ‚ÄúOFF‚Äù states:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="javascript">
  class Toggle extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {isToggleOn: true};

    // This binding is necessary to make `this` work in the callback
    this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this);
  }

  handleClick() {
    this.setState(prevState => ({
      isToggleOn: !prevState.isToggleOn
    }));
  }

  render() {
    return (
      &lt;button onClick={this.handleClick}&gt;
        {this.state.isToggleOn ? 'ON' : 'OFF'}
      &lt;/button&gt;
    );
  }
}
        </code></pre>

        <p>
          You have to be careful about the meaning of this in JSX callbacks. In
          JavaScript, class methods are not bound by default. If you forget to
          bind this.handleClick and pass it to onClick, this will be undefined
          when the function is actually called. This is not React-specific
          behavior; it is a part of how functions work in JavaScript. Generally,
          if you refer to a method without () after it, such as
          onClick={this.handleClick}, you should bind that method. If calling
          bind annoys you, there are two ways you can get around this. You can
          use public class fields syntax to correctly bind callbacks:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="javascript">class LoggingButton extends React.Component {
  // This syntax ensures `this` is bound within handleClick.
  handleClick = () => {
    console.log('this is:', this);
  };
  render() {
    return (
      &lt;button onClick={this.handleClick}&gt;
        Click me
      &lt;/button&gt;
    );
  }
}</code></pre>
        <p>
          This syntax is enabled by default in Create React App. If you aren‚Äôt
          using class fields syntax, you can use an arrow function in the
          callback:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="javascript">class LoggingButton extends React.Component {
  handleClick() {
    console.log('this is:', this);
  }

  render() {
    // This syntax ensures `this` is bound within handleClick
    return (
      &lt;button onClick={() => this.handleClick()}&gt;
        Click me
      &lt;/button&gt;
    );
  }
}</code></pre>
        <p>
          The problem with this syntax is that a different callback is created
          each time the LoggingButton renders. In most cases, this is fine.
          However, if this callback is passed as a prop to lower components,
          those components might do an extra re-rendering. We generally
          recommend binding in the constructor or using the class fields syntax,
          to avoid this sort of performance problem.
        </p>
        <h2>Passing Arguments to Event Handlers</h2>
        <p>
          Inside a loop, it is common to want to pass an extra parameter to an
          event handler. For example, if id is the row ID, either of the
          following would work:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="javascript">&lt;button onClick={(e) => this.deleteRow(id, e)}&gt;Delete Row&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;button onClick={this.deleteRow.bind(this, id)}&gt;Delete Row&lt;/button&gt;</code></pre>
        <p>
          The above two lines are equivalent, and use arrow functions and
          Function.prototype.bind respectively. In both cases, the e argument
          representing the React event will be passed as a second argument after
          the ID. With an arrow function, we have to pass it explicitly, but
          with bind any further arguments are automatically forwarded.
