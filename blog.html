      <h2>Understanding ACID Properties in DBMS: Ensuring Data Integrity
      </h2>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
      <p>
        In the world of database management systems (DBMS), ensuring data integrity is paramount. To achieve this, DBMS
        designers and developers rely on a set of fundamental principles known as ACID properties. ACID, which stands for
        Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability, forms the bedrock of database transactions, ensuring that data
        remains reliable and accurate in the face of system failures, concurrent access, and other potential issues.
